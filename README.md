# svd_angle_between_vectors
The following script perform singular value decomposition (SVD) the chosen and extracts the fist eigenvector. This process mimics the process of 'fitting' a vector to 3D data. This is particularly useful for measuring angle between two alpha helicies in a simulation trajectory. Alternatively, it can also used to angle fluctuations with respect to a particular axis.

Prerequisite to the script are `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` (optional). The script can be directly modified for use.
